# MovieMatch

This project now uses React Native written in TypeScript. It provides simple login and signup screens to help you integrate authentication in a mobile app.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. To run the Metro bundler:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. To launch on Android:
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```
   Or on iOS (requires macOS):
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```

The forms currently show alert messages on submission. Replace these with calls to your backend or add Google signâ€‘in as needed.
