# MovieMatch

This simple prototype includes login and signup pages with optional Google sign-in integration.

## Getting Started

1. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` in `index.html` and `signup.html` with a valid client ID from the [Google Identity Services](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web).
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to test login.
3. Open `signup.html` in a browser to test sign up.

The forms currently display alert messages on submission. Integrate them with your backend to handle real authentication.
